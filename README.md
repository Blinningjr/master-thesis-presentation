# master-thesis-presentation
This repository contains my master thesis presentation on "[Improving Debugging For Optimized Rust Code](./master-thesis-presentation.pdf)".

The beamer template I am using is [Simple Beamer Theme by Pin-Yen Huang](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/simple-beamer-theme/cyjyxkdttqzs).


The [master thesis report](https://github.com/Blinningjr/master-thesis.git) can be found in this repository.
It also contains links to the source code of the different projects.
